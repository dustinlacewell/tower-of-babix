* Tower of Babix

Tons of languages. Tons of snippets. Run them all!

*Quickstart*:

If you have Nix and Emacs, from the repository root:

#+begin_src sh
  lorri init              # activate lorri in repo
  direnv allow            # let direnv work here
  nix-shell                   # download/install compilers/runtimes
  emacs -l babix.el babix.org # install emacs language modes
#+end_src

/The initial install will take ..a while./

Once running, =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= on any code-block.

** What is this?

It's kind of like [[http://www.rosettacode.org/][Rosetta Code]], but you can actually run all the snippets.

By leveraging [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]], you can browse and /execute/ snippets from our library right
inside [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

Of course you can write your own snippets too!

** How does it work?

Emacs has a crazy package called [[https://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]] which is like a souped up Markdown
made by nerd geniuses (god bless them).

One of its features is that it can execute code-blocks.

But in order to execute block of various languages, you need all those
compilers and runtimes.

That's where Nix comes in with [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell][nix-shell]] which lets you install them all into a
little isolated shell environment.

To get Emacs to see the `$PATH` from the perspective of the nix-shell, it talks to
[[https://direnv.net/][Direnv]] via [[https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv][emacs-direnv]] which talks to [[https://github.com/target/lorri][Lorri]].

Finally we have a bit of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][Emacs Lisp]] to [[./babix.el][tie it all together]].
