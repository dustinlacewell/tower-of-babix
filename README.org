* Tower of Babix

Tons of languages. Tons of snippets. Run them all!

*Quickstart*:

If you have Nix then clone the repo and:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -i -f .
  babix babix.org
#+end_src

/The initial install will take ..a while./

Once running, =Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= on any code-block.

*Installation*:

Add the following to your system or user packages:

#+begin_src nix
pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "dustinlacewell";
      repo = "tower-of-babix";
      rev = "a6c8ece992bffeae3788425dd4b3b5871e66a900";
      sha256 = "0ww2q5gykxm802z1kffmnrfahjlx123j1gfszklpsv0b1fccm100";
}
#+end_src

*Usage*:

#+begin_src text
  babix [BABIX-OPTS] [EMACS-OPTS]

  BABIX-OPTS:
    -h             list usage
    -themes        list theme names & exit
    -theme NAME    use theme called NAME

  EMACS-OPTS:
    typical Emacs options
#+end_src

The =babix= cli args are the same as `emacs` except:
- =-themes= will exit after printing the available themes
- =-theme THEME= will load =THEME= as some extra niceties

#+begin_src sh
  $ babix -theme default babix.org
#+end_src

** What is this?

It's kind of like [[http://www.rosettacode.org/][Rosetta Code]], but you can actually run all the snippets.

By leveraging [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]], you can browse and /execute/ snippets from our library right
inside [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

Of course you can write your own snippets too!

** How does it work?

Emacs has a crazy package called [[https://orgmode.org/][Orgmode]] which is like a souped up Markdown
made by nerd geniuses (god bless them).

One of its features is that it can execute code-blocks!

But in order to execute block of various languages, you need all those
compilers and runtimes.

Nix makes it easy to get them all to you.
